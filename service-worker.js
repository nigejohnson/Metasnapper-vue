      Without those two methods the default PWA design assumption is that the resources initially picked
      up when a user opens the app (which won't have been fetched by a service worker because then the service worker
      won't as yet even have been registered) are out of date, and should therefore carry on being controlled by
      any already running service workers until the user does their first page refresh or navigate.
      That assumption essentially forces the user to ALWAYS refresh the app after a new install on a Single Page
      style app (SPA) as there aren't any navigations, and so the service worker won't start fetching resources
      from the application cache until the user refreshes, meaning the SPA can't work properly offline until the
      user refreshes (so links don't do anything and appear broken, with errors logged about refused or unavailable
      connections because the given resources aren't yet available offline), which is horrid!
      (Especially as you are likely to be forced to adopt an SPA pattern for a variety of reasons, such as fairly long
        lasting indexeddb or other offline cache associated javascript processes that run asynchronously but
        will be terminated by a real page transition!)
